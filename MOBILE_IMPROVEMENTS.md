# Mobile Experience Improvements

## Summary of Changes

This update significantly improves the mobile experience for the GEPA Profile Generator app, with special focus on enabling gallery and camera photo selection on all platforms.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Enhanced File Input Handling**
- Added multiple file input elements with different `capture` attributes:
  - Primary input: Generic `accept="image/*"` (works on all platforms)
  - Environment capture: Camera with environment facing (rear camera)
  - User capture: Camera with user facing (front camera/selfie)

### 2. **Smart Mobile Detection**
- Added automatic mobile device detection using `navigator.userAgent`
- Provides platform-specific hints (iOS vs Android)
- Optimizes behavior based on detected platform

### 3. **Better Touch Targets**
- All buttons now have minimum height of 48px (iOS guideline) / 50px on small screens
- Improved tap areas for better mobile usability
- Added `-webkit-appearance: none` to prevent browser styling issues

### 4. **Improved Visual Feedback**
- Added helpful hints that appear on mobile devices
- Platform-specific instructions (e.g., "Press and hold" for iOS, "Choose from menu" for Android)
- Better loading states and error messages

### 5. **Enhanced Responsive Design**
- Larger minimum heights for interactive elements on mobile
- Better spacing and padding for touch interaction
- Improved text sizes to prevent accidental zoom on iOS
- Font size set to 16px on input fields to prevent auto-zoom on iOS

### 6. **Better Error Handling**
- More informative error messages
- Auto-scroll to relevant section after image upload
- Improved file validation with user-friendly feedback

### 7. **Input Reset**
- File input value is reset after selection, allowing the same file to be selected again

## File Selection Experience by Platform

- Tap upload area → Photos or Camera app selection
- Hint: "Press and hold to access Photos or Camera app"
- Works with gallery and camera capture

### Android

### Desktop

## Technical Details

<input type="file" id="photo-upload-user-camera" accept="image/*" capture="user">
<p class="upload-mobile-hint" id="upload-mobile-hint"></p>
```
